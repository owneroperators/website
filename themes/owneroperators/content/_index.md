**Owner Operators** is the solo recording project of Eric Eaglstun, a Boise-based songwriter and producer blending post-punk grit, indie grunge textures, and personal storytelling. The songs channel the spirit of artists like DEVO and Sturgill Simpson, fusing twangy existentialism with distorted guitars, analog synths, and a touch of defiant humor.

Built in home studios with a DIY ethos, the debut demo album embraces both raw emotion and digital experimentation—using AI tools not as shortcuts, but as collaborators in the creative process. Each track explores themes of autonomy, alienation, and metamodern fatherhood, with arrangements that balance human imperfection against mechanical precision.

Set to release by the end of 2025, Owner Operators will launch across streaming platforms and Bandcamp, accompanied by a hand-built website, limited vinyl pressing, and a return to live performance—with eyes on Treefort and beyond.
