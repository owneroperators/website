Verse 1
: Woke up to static and a burnt-out glow
: Running through echoes of a past I know
: The world was a blur, summers endless and strange
: Laughed in the chaos, never thought we'd change

Chorus
: Salad days, slipping through cracks
: Rolling down hills, never looking back
: Now the neon hum fills up my nights
: Still chasing shadows of the fading lights

Verse 2
: Reflections dance on broken glass
: Dreams get tangled, time moves fast
: We danced with ghosts, felt it all unwind
: Now it's all screens, and we're losing our minds

Chorus
: Salad days, slipping through cracks
: Rolling down hills, never looking back
: Now the neon hum fills up my nights
: Still chasing shadows of the fading lights

Bridge
: Tomorrows blur and yesterdays fade
: Hold on tight to whatever remains
: The past and the present blur at the seams
: We're always longing for the days in between

Chorus
: Salad days, slipping through cracks
: Rolling down hills, never looking back
: Now the neon hum fills up my nights
: Still chasing shadows of the fading lights

Outro
: Spinning through moments, theyâ€™re never too far
: The best days are always right where we are
