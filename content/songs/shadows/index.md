Verse 1
: Underneath the endless highway signs
: Metal beasts glide where the twilight shines
: Neon shadows twist with the rumbling bass
: Roadside figures in this endless chase.

Pre-chorus
: Circuit dreams in a rubber-stamped land
: I keep driving, don’t help me to stand.

Chorus
: Rolling through cities, I’m a ghost in the night
: With phantom glances, we make wrongs feel right
: The glow of the streetlights, electric delight
: Chasing tomorrow in this surreal flight.

Verse 2
: Chasing visions in the rearview’s grasp
: City blues twist, fade and rasp
: Curious dancers in the moonlit haze
: Faltering whispers through the tire tracks lay.

Pre-chorus
: Pavement echoes where the lost hearts meld
: Haunted grooves where fantasies dwelled.

Chorus
: Rolling through cities, I’m a ghost in the night
: With phantom glances, we make wrongs feel right
: The glow of the streetlights, electric delight
: Chasing tomorrow in this surreal flight.

Outro
: Onward I steer through this shadowy maze
: From dusk to dawn, I drift in a daze.
