Verse 1
: I water my grass at the recommended time
: Got a Ring on the door and a fence with a sign
: My neighbor and I, we don't really talk
: But we wave from our driveways at 8 o'clock

Chorus
: Oh, I’m safe, I’m sound, I’m totally fine
: Trapped in a loop like a factory line
: Give me sidewalks, give me skies
: Just don’t ask me if I’m alive

Verse 2
: There’s a sale on grills at the hardware store
: And a prayer in chalk on the driveway floor
: Someone’s kid just made the honor roll
: I forgot how to feel, but I’m meeting my goals

Chorus
: Oh, I’m safe, I’m sound, I’m totally fine
: Trapped in a loop like a factory line
: Give me sidewalks, give me skies
: Just don’t ask me if I’m alive

Bridge
: Drove fifteen minutes for organic greens
: Waved at a stranger—thought it was a dream
: Joined a club to feel less alone
: Now I’m ghosting folks from the comfort of home

Verse 3
: One of my skills? I can park a van
: Parallel, blindfolded, part of the plan
: I dream of a mullet I’ll never reveal
: 'Cause wanting too much might make it too real

Chorus
: Oh, I’m safe, I’m sound, I’m totally fine
: Trapped in a loop like a factory line
: Give me sidewalks, give me skies
: Just don’t ask me if I’m alive
