Verse 1
: There's a mall in my head where the mannequins vote
: I scream in the food court—nobody takes note
: My timeline’s a landfill of simulated grace
: While a feedback god whispers in lowercase

Verse 2
: Bureaucrats bloom like mold on the wall
: We pledge to the flag in a conference call
: Your favorite war has a merch table now
: And I still don’t know who wrote the vow

Chorus
: Swipe left for the end of days
: We dance in a spreadsheet maze
: Love me like a failing state
: With soft denial and interest rates
: This isn’t real, but it’s more than a dream—
: We’re ghosts in the vending machine

Verse 3
: Sodium skies and fluorescent moons
: I pray to the click with a thousand runes
: Your soul’s been cached in a server farm
: They’ll beta test your nervous charm

Bridge
: Cracked smiles in recursive hells
: Where truth just pings and never dwells
: But I found a map on a glitchy screen
: Drawn in crayon, marked “in between”

Final Chorus
: Swipe right for a holy glitch
: A joke, a cry, a nervous twitch
: Code me soft in post-truth light
: And hold me through the feedback night
: This isn’t hope, but it isn’t despair—
: It’s a shrug, a spark, synthetic prayer
