Verse 1
: She’s born into fire, in the wake of the storm,
: Where the ground feels broken, but the future’s warm.
: I see the screens flicker, wires in the sky,
: The Old Gods twitching, but they won’t die.

Chorus
: Caught in the chaos, guided by the wire,
: Building from ashes, rising through the fire.
: No clear answers, just codes to crack,
: Hope in the glitch, and no turning back.

Verse 2
: The Oceans of Slime, the Cities of Smoke,
: The Beautiful Mutants rise and choke.
: But in her hands, there’s a spark of life,
: To build a new world, from chaos and strife.

Chorus
: Caught in the chaos, guided by the wire,
: Building from ashes, rising through the fire.
: No clear answers, just codes to crack,
: Hope in the glitch, and no turning back.

Bridge
: The SubGenius preachers call out for slack,
: As Data Lords march, but there’s no looking back.
: She’ll walk the line, between flesh and machine,
: With Beautiful Mutants and dreams unseen.

Verse 3
: They promised control, but sold us lies,
: Chained to the pixels, where freedom dies.
: But she’ll break the loop, rewrite the plan,
: With Beautiful Mutants and hope in her hands.

Chorus
: Caught in the chaos, guided by the wire,
: Building from ashes, rising through the fire.
: No clear answers, just codes to crack,
: Hope in the glitch, and no turning back.
