Verse 1
: You say we’re like a signal lost and found
: Tuning into something deep underground
: Static in the night, but it feels so real
: A dial that’s spinning, but we’re clicking in steel
: The city hums its neon lullaby
: We’re caught between the high-rise and the sky
: Flashing on and off, all the green and red
: But there’s no map for the roads in my head

Chorus
: Oh, I don’t need a perfect plan
: We’re just two dots across the screen
: Colliding like some grand mistake
: But every glitch becomes routine
: Love’s a language that I thought I’d learned
: But it twists and turns like a program burned
: We’re caught in the data stream, feeling human
: And I think that’s enough

Verse 2
: We dance around the edges, careful tread
: Plastic cups and echoes, words left unsaid
: Your eyes hold a million pixel points of light
: Like I’m staring at the edge of what could be right
: You laugh, and there’s irony between the lines
: Playing catch with moments, borrowing time
: Patching up the breaks, letting patches fall
: Trying to navigate without a protocol

Chorus
: Oh, I don’t need a crystal screen
: To understand what’s coming through
: Every glitch is a sign, a broken beat
: Telling me to lean closer to you
: Love’s a system full of faulty code
: But it runs just fine when we let it go
: We’re caught in the data stream, feeling human
: And I think that’s enough

Bridge
: If there’s a meaning to this, we’ll decrypt it in time
: Lost in translation, but you say it’s fine
: Let the pixels blur, let the signals bend
: We’ll stay in this frequency until the end

Outro
: Every byte, every beat, every scattered cue
: Feels like something real, something close to true
: In a sea of noise, your voice breaks through
: And that’s more than enough for me and you
