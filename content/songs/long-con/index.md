Verse 1
: This world spins backwards, but I’m movin’ on,
: With plastic dreams and digital dawn,
: Neon shadows dance on a broken screen,
: We’re promised the future, but what does it mean?

Chorus
: It’s the long con, the big charade,
: Runnin’ in circles in the mess they made,
: Truth and lies are playin’ in a roundelay,
: Laughin’ at the chaos in a plastic masquerade.

Bridge
: They say we gotta evolve, but it feels like decay,
: A devolution revolution, watch it slip away,
: Cogs in the machine, thinkin’ we’re free,
: But the more we change, the less we seem to be.

Verse 2
: Wave your flag of irony high,
: Dance like a puppet without knowing why,
: Maybe the answer’s in the question we ask,
: Or is it just another fool wearin’ a mask?

Chorus
: It’s the long con, we’re playin’ along,
: Keepin’ time to an artificial song,
: Truth twists around in a meta-modern haze,
: We cheer as we stumble through the endless maze.

Outro
: Pull the strings, turn the gears,
: The joke’s on us, it’s been for years,
: Laugh or cry, it all feels the same,
: Just actors in a rerun of a rigged game.
